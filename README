I created a Tika based StringBridge to convert any byte[] to its string representation.

When unit-testing this StringBrige everything works fine.

When integration-testing this StringBriget some element does not work.

The associated bug report is here : https://hibernate.onjira.com/browse/HSEARCH-1171
